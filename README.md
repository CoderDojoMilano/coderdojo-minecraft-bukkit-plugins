Building and Running
--------------------
Glowstone can be built with the
[Java Development Kit](http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) and [Gradle](http://gradle.org).
The command `gradlew` will build the Plugin and put the final jar in `build/libs/`. Other tasks are listed under `gradlew tasks`.
A local installation of Gradle can be used instead if desired.

To install the Plugin copy the jar into `plugins/` folder of your server, tested on [Glowstone server 1.8](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/tree/1.8)
